### Query Parameter:
 Some APIs allow you to refine your request further with key-value pairs called query parameters.  
1. Query parameters are added to the end of the path. They start with a question mark <strong>?</strong> , followed by the key-value pairs in the format: < key > = < value >
2. If there are multiple query parameters, each is separated by an ampersand "&"

### Path
Another way of passing request data to an API is via path variables (a.k.a. "path parameters"). A path variable is a dynamic section of a path and is often used for IDs and entity names such as usernames. 
 #### Path vs. query parameters
At first, it is easy to confuse these two parameter types. Let's compare them side by side. 

|Path Variable|	Query parameters|
|--------------|--------------|
|ex: /books/abc123	|ex: /books?search=borgescheckedOut=false|
| Located directly after a slash in the path. It can be anywhere on the path |	Located only at the end of a path, right after a question mark ? |
| Accepts dynamic values|	Accepts defined query keys with potentially dynamic values.|
| * Often used for IDs or entity names|	* Often used for options and filters|
* These are just conventions! Some APIs might ask you to pass an ID or username in a query parameter like this: /users?username=getpostman
